Overview

* Due to incorrect manipulation and eavesdropper interception, there is a problem with data security and privacy.
To safeguard the transferred data, whether it takes the form of text, images, or even audio signals, numerous strategies are required.
Cryptography has a defining role in the field of network security.

Motivation

* Numerous studies have examined audio encryption algorithms with the ultimate goal to achieve a good balance of speed and security
Internet has created inappropriate prospects which are hazardous for the confidentiality and integrity of the multimedia data.
Security is considered as an important element in the audio communication, voice-over internet protocols, secret voice seminars, and business sections

Audio Encryption Requirements

* Key Space
* Perceptual Security
* Key Sensitivity
* Resist different attacks

Mono - Alphabetic Cipher

* Substitution Cipher
* Symmetric encryption
* Same key can be used to both encrypt and decrypt a message 
* Fixed key - 26 letters of a “shuffled alphabet”

Hill Cipher
* Substitution Cipher
* Block Cipher

Conclusion

* These ciphers were among the very first cipher systems.
* These are good in completely retrieving the hidden messages and good in minimizing the noise .
* SecretPy and Sympy plays major roles in this implementations.
* Audio cryptography still has wide prospect to grow.
